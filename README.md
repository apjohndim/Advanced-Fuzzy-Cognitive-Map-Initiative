Version 0.2

For the State Space and Rule Embedded version of the AFCM, use REAFCM.py

Needs specific weight tables to run (simulation weight tables are included)

Current issues:

1. Script works with only 31 inputs, 3 states, for Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis using attributes as shown in input.xlsx
2. Available activation functions include sigmoid and tanh
